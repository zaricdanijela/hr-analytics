# HR Analytics

## Overview

### Handling missing data
Missing values were handled using a few ways:
- fill values based on mode value
- fill values based on median
- simple fill with 0

### Exploratory Data Analysis
A variety of graphs to better visualize and understand the data. Different types of graphs were used for different types of variables.

### Machine learning models
Different ML models were trained. Certain metric were chosen to evaluate these models. Many comments are provided about that.
The following ML models were used:
- KNN classifier
- Decision Tree classifier
- Random forest classifier


### How to use
The jupyter-notebook **"main_notebook.ipynb"** is enough and contains all of the code, coupled with the necessary comments.
To run the notebook, upload it to the google-collab environment, or run it locally. If running locally, install all required packgages by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
